## WinAPI-TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe WINAPI32 C++ desktop application I made for an assignment back in university. 

Requirements were to:
- Play by having two instances of this application open - one for X and one for O (trying to open the third instanse will not work)
- Use mapping to share data between those instances
- Have four different ways to save/load window data: fstream, mapping to file, fprintf, WinAPI file handler
- Have background gradient animation
